                    <p>the shrine where Mitsuha prepares Kuchikamizake, the sacred alcohol for the Gods. The model is in fact the Hie-jinja shrine located in Takayama, in the Gifu prefecture. The Torii is a little bit different but otherwise we find the same atmosphere.</p>

                    <p>This lake located in Nagato prefecture is the perfect place to take a break and enjoy the beautiful view at night.</p>
                    <p>Itomori Lake, the main place of the film, is inspired by a real lake which is Suwa Lake, in Nagano Prefecture.
                        <br>The story of the film in the countryside is supposed to take place in Gifu Prefecture, but Makoto Shinkai, the author of the film, has blurred the lines a little by inserting this lake whose model is in Nagano Prefecture.
                        <br>Makoto Shinkai being native of Nagano prefecture, he surely wanted to integrate a place of his home.</p>
